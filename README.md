## DumbWeaver
for *nix, made using WSL2 debian

started with following a tutorial for dumb simple C server on youtube, kind of developed into experimentation with ncurses as well as messing around with html using c-style strings, probably won't get too far before I get bored

for ncurses library:
sudo apt-get install libncursesw5-dev

everything else should be included in GCC by default
